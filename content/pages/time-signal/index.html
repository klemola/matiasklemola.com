          I received a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W" target="_blank">Casio F-91W watch</a>
          for my birthday. The manual mentioned the possibility of syncronizing the seconds using a
          time signal. However, I couldn't find a simple online GTS tool like this.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The Greenwich Time Signal (GTS), popularly known as the pips, is a series of six short
          tones (or "pips") broadcast at one-second intervals by many BBC Radio stations.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are six pips (short beeps) in total, which occur on each of the 5 seconds leading up
          to the hour and on the hour itself. Each pip is a 1 kHz tone (about a fifth of a semitone
          above musical B5) the first five of which last a tenth of a second each, while the final
          pip lasts half a second. The actual moment when the hour changes – the "on-time marker" –
          is at the very beginning of the last pip.
