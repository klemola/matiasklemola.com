## Good day, guest!

I'm Matias, a software developer with boundless curiosity.

At work I build web services, apps, and platforms. You can see my handiwork in ticket vending machines, when you order groceries online, or when you browse high-end apartments.

I'm into game development, which I'm learning in my spare time. I'm involved in all aspects of it: game design, art, sounds, and programming.

Music is another major interest of mine. I play the guitar, piano, and bass, and know my way around digital music production. I currently play bass in a garage rock band.

In essence, I gravitate towards creative things and problem-solving. I regularly defy gravity by bouldering. I live in Helsinki, Finland, with my family of three.

You can reach me at [hello@matiasklemola.com](mailto:hello@matiasklemola.com), and I'm somewhat active on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@yourmagicisworking).
