## Good day, guest!

I'm Matias, a software developer with boundless curiosity.

I work at the Finnish Broadcasting Company, in the domain of user accounts and personalization. Previously, I worked as a software consultant. You can see my handiwork in ticket vending machines, when you order groceries online, or when you browse high-end apartments.

As a hobby, I'm learning game development. This involves all aspects: game design, art, sound, and programming. Most of my efforts go towards [Liikennematto](/liikennematto-devlog-five), a tiny town-building game with traffic simulation.

Music is another major interest of mine. I play guitar, piano, and bass, and I'm familiar with digital music production. Currently, I play bass in the garage rock band [Paimentolaiselämä](https://paimentolaiselama.bandcamp.com).

In essence, I gravitate towards creative things and problem-solving. I regularly defy gravity by bouldering. I live in Helsinki, Finland, with my family of four.

You can reach me at [hello@matiasklemola.com](mailto:hello@matiasklemola.com), and see what I'm up to on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@yourmagicisworking) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/matiasklemola.com).
