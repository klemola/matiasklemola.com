## Code

### Foobar2000 Web UI

I was looking for a nice remote control app for Foobar2000, which is a popular music player for Windows. None of the existing solutions were simple enough, so I created a prototype that allowed me to control playback and see details of currently playing track over local network. It has since grown into a pretty reliable tool.

One can use any modern device with a browser to access an UI that sends commands to a TCP server running inside Foobar2000. User actions and changes in Foobar2000 playback status trigger events that sync the playback status between the UI and music player.

### Butsku

Butsku was my solo project in which I experimented with song structures and sound design. Many of the songs are based on loops and vary in genres from shoegaze to psychedelic hip-hop. The music is influenced by 60s psychedelic rock, shoegaze, funk, hip-hop and modern experimental music.
